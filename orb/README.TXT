VBOrb.DLL
---------

This directory contains the VBOrb itself. You need this classes
to build the VBOrb.DLL which is used by every VBOrb application.

(It is also possible to include the sources into one VB project
without using a DLL.)

If you are using VBOrb.DLL and you like to run and debug the
application in your VB development environment then you should
use the OrbRunLoopOutsideOfDLL() method as shown in the callback
example (See vb/demos/callback/fServer.frm).
