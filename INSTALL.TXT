Installing VBOrb
================

To install VBOrb and to test VBOrb do the following
---------------------------------------------------

1. Extract all files of the VBOrb.zip distribution by using
   WinZIP or Java jar tool.

2. Open the orb/VBOrb.vbp project file.
   a) Generate the VBOrb.dll file. (By that VB will also register
      the VBOrb.dll on your system.)
      Later if you distribute a VBOrb application you have to build
      a setup.exe otherwise your application will not work.
      (Or use the regsvr32 Windows utility to register the VBOrb.dll
      on a foreign computer by yourself.)
   b) Save and close the VBOrb project.

3. For example test the DB client/server example application
   a) Open the demos/db_query/DBQuery.vbp client project file.
      - IMPORTANT: Check the project references.
        Maybe delete unknown VBOrb reference. Close the reference box.
        Then reopen reference box and add right project reference
        to your VBOrb.dll.
      - Generate the DBQuery.exe file.
   b) Open the demos/db_server/DBServer.vbp project file.
      - IMPORTANT: Check the project references.
        Maybe delete unknown VBOrb reference. Close the reference box.
        Then reopen reference box and add right project reference
        to your VBOrb.dll.
   c) Generate the DBServer.exe file.
   d) Start the DBServer.exe and the DBQuery.exe
   e) See how the DB client/server example works.


If you would like to develop your own CORBA applications in VB
you will need to install a Java Runtime Environment for the IDL2VB
compiler.
